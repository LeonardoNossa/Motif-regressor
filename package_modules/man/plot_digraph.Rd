\title{Plot Bipartite Graph of Motifs and Conditions}
\usage{
plot_digraph(motif_names, edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{motif_names}{A character vector containing the names of motifs.}

\item{edges}{A data frame containing the edges of the graph.}

\item{condition_names}{A character vector containing the names of conditions.}
}
\value{
A Plotly object displaying an interactive bipartite graph where:
\itemize{
\item Motifs and conditions are represented as nodes.
\item Edges connecting nodes are color-coded based on the importance
values (\code{coef}).
\item Node hover labels provide additional information such as type
(motif/condition).
}
}
\description{
This function generates a bipartite directed graph that visualizes
relationships between motifs and conditions. The edges represent the
importance of connections (e.g., regression coefficients), and the graph is
rendered interactively using Plotly.
